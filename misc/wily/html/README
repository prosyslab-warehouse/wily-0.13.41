Wily html tools:

README		this file
guide		guide file
bin/		script directory, contains the following programs:

    books	removes un-needed tags from Netscape bookmark files
    href	generate an href

    html1	bold italic underline

    indent	indent - by one tab
    mdate	metric date?
    quote	quote - for email
    remote	tell netscape to open a URL
    sdate	short-form date
    skel	create a skeletal html document (a good thing to start with)
    ulhref	create an unordered list, where each list item is an href
    ullist	create a simple unordered list
    undent	undent - by one tab
    unquote	unquote - for email

All scripts assume rc is in /bin/rc, so they can run under acme on plan9
unmodified (though I haven't tested it yet).

This package should be installed under $home/wily/html
and you should make sure $home/wily/html/bin is in your path
To set things up, 'cd' to the bin directory and run 'make', which
sets up a bunch of symbolic links to the html and html1 scripts,
then just point wily at $home/wily/html/guide
