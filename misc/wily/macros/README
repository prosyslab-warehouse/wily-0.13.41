Some Wily macros:

README		this file
acme		rc script - start up wily with some nice macros
guide		guide file
h		history program, by Gary
magic		magic-cat program
utf		sample UTF text
wbiff		wily biff
wilytools	wilytools for wily freaks, additions welcome

The acme script sets some variables (SHELL, HISTORY, $mail),
reads in your .rcrc file if you have one, defines some useful
functions for code browsing (untarz, gre, def, uses),
and then fires up wily with $home and $home/wily/macros/guide open.

The guide file assumes you have the html tools in $home/html
and has strings for common programming and editing tasks.

The 3 different grep functions are listed by decreasing generality:
- gre  is likely to get many 'hits' in large source directories
- sg   is a general-purpose source grep
- def  searches for function definitions, assumed to start at column 1.
- uses searches for variable/function calls, it depends on 'grep -w',
       which is available from gnu-grep if your system doesn't support it.  

The second line of the guide file forms a primitive mail interface.
Click B2 on 'frm' (the elm program) to list your messages,
click B2 on $mail to view your mailbox,
select some text that contains a valid 'To: ' header
and then fire B2 on sendmail to quickly send some mail,
or if you want to use the aliases in your .mailrc file
you can use the ">mail -s 'subject' who" guide instead.

I install these files in $home/wily/macros
